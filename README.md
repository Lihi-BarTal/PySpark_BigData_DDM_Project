# 📊 Distributed Information Management & Big Data Analysis

**Python Project Portfolio using PySpark in a Distributed Environment**

---

## 💡 Overview
This repository showcases solutions for complex Big Data challenges, focusing on distributed data management, optimization, and advanced analytics using the **Apache Spark** framework (implemented in PySpark/Databricks Notebooks).

## 🎯 Core Technical Areas

The portfolio demonstrates expertise in three key phases of large-scale data processing:

1.  **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering:** Implementing complex data cleaning and transformation pipelines using PySpark DataFrames and Spark SQL.
2.  **Strategic Optimization:** Utilizing Spark for strategic analysis and **Influence Maximization** queries to optimize broadcasting decisions.
3.  **Advanced Analytics:** Implementing **Clustering Algorithms** (e.g., for viewing habits) and performing **Real-Time Streaming Analysis** on evolving data.
